# Raiding-bot-discord
KTZI V1 (Stable) is a simplistic raiding bot designed in python.
This bot is designed to push the discord API to its limits and maximise the damage.

To run, all you have to do is run the main.py file, and the bot will do the rest.

This bot is made solely for educational purposes. I do not take any responsibly for what happens to the user, bot or the server this code is used executed in. 
All code made using or based off this code is not endorsed. 
I do not endorse, support or encourage API abuse.
